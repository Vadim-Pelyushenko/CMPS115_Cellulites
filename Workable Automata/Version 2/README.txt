The 2nd version of some workable automata.
This does exactly the same thing as the previous one.

The main difference is that it is organized better and abstracted as the interaction between objects.
Much like the previous version, this is a standalone thing. If you open index.html into your brower
(and make sure the .js files are also in the folder index.html is contained in) and run it, it'll work.
