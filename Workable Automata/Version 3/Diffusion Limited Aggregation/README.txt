Yet another Cellular Automata

It should be noted for this one that there have been some changes to the main structure of the code
Namely that
-Cells are updated in a random order in this(I need to make this a feature later on)
-The futureState is made as a copy of the current state

The main reason for the first thing is indicated in a picture place in this folder. (In short, a bias occurs)
The reason for the second thing is that this CA doesn't work without it. (Need to investigate why, I think it should work without it)
